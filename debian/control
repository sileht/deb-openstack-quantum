Description: OpenStack Virtual network service - server
 Quantum provides an API to dynamically request and configure virtual networks.
 These networks connect "interfaces" from other OpenStack services (e.g., vNICs
 from Nova VMs). The Quantum API supports extensions to provide advanced network
 capabilities (e.g., QoS, ACLs, network monitoring, etc).
 .
 This package provides the quantum server.

Description: Quantum is a virutal network service for Openstack. (python library)
 Quantum is a virtual network service for Openstack, and a part of
 Netstack. Just like OpenStack Nova provides an API to dynamically
 request and configure virtual servers, Quantum provides an API to
 dynamically request and configure virtual networks. These networks
 connect "interfaces" from other OpenStack services (e.g., virtual NICs
 from Nova VMs). The Quantum API supports extensions to provide
 advanced network capabilities (e.g., QoS, ACLs, network monitoring,
 etc.)
 .
 This package provides the python library.
