Description: OpenStack Virtual network service (common files)
 Quantum provides an API to dynamically request and configure virtual networks. 
 These networks connect "interfaces" from other OpenStack services (e.g., vNICs 
 from Nova VMs). The Quantum API supports extensions to provide advanced network 
 capabilities (e.g., QoS, ACLs, network monitoring, etc)
 .
 This package provides the core bianries and libraries to manage quantum
